Note to Mike: The scope of this homework was a stretch for me as it has been a long time since I have been working in pure development.

I spent a full 8-10 hour day researching how to do parts I did not already know and put together the enclosed app.

I am aware that there is a bug that is causing the unit tests to not run. I have reworked the code back and forth many times, but just could not resolve that issue.

Thank you,
Andrew
